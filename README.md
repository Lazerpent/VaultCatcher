VaultCatcher is a simple Torn script designed for faction bankers. It adds a confirmation if you attempt to give a user more money than their active balance.

Note: There is no guarantee this will function 100% of the time â€“ if Torn updates and changes something it could break this script, if an adblocker does something weird, it could break this script. This is not meant to replace you continuing to check your amounts, but hopefully, this script will catch mistakes.
